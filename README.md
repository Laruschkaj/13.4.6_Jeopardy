# 13.4.6_Jeopardy
This is a functioning interactive game of Jeopardy!

Assignment: 
Jeopardy Project

## **It‚Äôs Jeopardy!**

**Using jQuery and AJAX**, you‚Äôll build a small, straightforward Jeopardy game. 

You will be using the API listed here: **https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/categories?count=10**

### **The API**

In order to fetch the correct data you will be using an external **API**. The "endpoint" is [https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api](https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/categories?count=10) .

We will need two following subsequent endpoints:

1. **GET** "https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/categories?count=[integer]"
2. **GET** "[https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/category?id=[integer](https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/api/category?id=[**integer**)]"

**Retrieving Category Data**

Firstly, we will need to retrieve **Category** data for our questions. The format for the **URL** is the following:

**GET** "[https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/categories?count=[integer](https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/api/categories?count=[**integer**)]"

To review our concepts. The **API** documentation is telling us that we can plug in a number in the **count=[integer]** part of the URL and the API will fetch us the data which we need.

The **GET** request will fetch us the following data:

```jsx
*let res = await axios.get(`https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/categories?count=100`)

// NOTICE WE HAVE PROVIDED THE VALUE 100 FOR THE <count> query, what happens if the value is changed? //

// what is in our res variable? //

// checking out res.data will produce the following result //

[

{

"id": 2,

"title": "baseball",

"clues_count": 5

},

{

"id": 3,

"title": "odd jobs",

"clues_count": 5

},

{

"id": 4,

"title": "movies",

"clues_count": 5

},

{

"id": 6,

"title": "\"cat\" egory",

"clues_count": 5

},

// and so on until 100 objects in an array*

]*

```

### **Retrieving Questions in a Specific Category**

Now that you know how to retrieve all available categories, think about how you can retrieve questions in a specific category:

To review, the format for the URL is the following:

**GET** "[https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api/category?id=[**integer**](https://rithm-jeopardy.herokuapp.com/api/category?id=[**integer**)]"

Just like in the previous example the **API** is telling us that if we plug in a number in the **id=integer** part of the **URL** we will receive an appropriate response.

For example:

```jsx
*let res = await axios.get(`"https://projects.springboard.com/jeopardy/api.... What should our URL look like here ... ?`)
// HINT: Look at the example above //

// what is in our res variable? //

// what will our result be? //

// Good luck! //

};*

```

**Working Further with the API**

Before you begin the project, explore the **API**. What happens when you limit the responses in the first **URL**? (i.e 'count=5') or if you try to **GET** a Category which does NOT exist (i.e "id=0").

### **Requirements**

- The game board should be 6 categories across, 5 question down, displayed in a table. Above this should be a header row with the name of each category.
- At the start of the game, you should randomly pick 6 categories from the jService API. For each category, you should randomly select 5 questions for that category.
- Initially, the board should show with¬†**?**¬†on each spot on the board (on the real TV show, it shows dollar amount, but we won‚Äôt implement this).
- When the user clicks on a clue¬†**?**, it should replace that with the question text.
- When the user clicks on a visible question on the board, it should change to the answer (if they click on a visible answer, nothing should happen)
- When the user clicks the ‚ÄúRestart‚Äù button at the bottom of the page, it should load new categories and questions.

We‚Äôve provided an HTML file and CSS for the application (you shouldn‚Äôt change the HTML file; if you want to tweak any CSS things, feel free to).

We‚Äôve also provided a starter JS file with function definitions. Implement these functions to meet the required functionality.

üí° **Randomly picking multiple things**

In the requirements, we‚Äôve asked for 6 random categories. Unfortunately, the jService API doesn‚Äôt have a method that returns a random category ‚Äî you‚Äôll need to figure this out.

There are a few possible strategies here:

- Get a bunch of categories, and keep randomly choosing one, making sure you don‚Äôt choose the same one twice.
- Get a bunch of categories, shuffle them, then pick the first 6. Unfortunately, Javascript doesn‚Äôt have a built-in shuffle function, but you can find hints online on how to make one.
- Find a function that will pick¬†*n*¬†random things for you. This is often called ‚Äúsampling‚Äù. There‚Äôs a popular library for Javascript, Lodash, which provides a function that can sample a particular number of items from a larger list, making sure there are no duplicates.
